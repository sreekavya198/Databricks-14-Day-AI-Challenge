# Day 2 — Databricks 14-Day AI Challenge 

Day 2 was all about getting hands-on with Spark DataFrames and understanding how basic transformations work on large datasets.

## What I worked on today 

👉 Uploaded and loaded a sample e-commerce CSV file into Databricks
👉Explored the data using display() and select()
👉Applied filtering logic (price > 100) to understand data distribution
👉Grouped data by event_type to analyze user behavior (view, cart, purchase)
👉Identified top 5 brands by event count
👉Learned how null values impact aggregations and fixed it by excluding them

## Key learnings 

👉How Spark handles large datasets efficiently using lazy evaluation
👉Practical use of groupBy, count, orderBy, and limit
👉Why data cleaning (like handling nulls) is critical before analysis
👉Difference between raw results vs meaningful insights after filtering

Small steps, but solid foundations in Spark and Databricks
