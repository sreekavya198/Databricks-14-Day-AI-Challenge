# Day 1 — Databricks 14 Days AI Challenge

**Status:** Completed 
**Focus:** Databricks + Lakehouse basics

### What I Learnt Today:

- Why Databricks vs Pandas/Hadoop?
- Lakehouse architecture basics
- Databricks workspace structure
- Industry use cases (Netflix, Shell, Comcast)

### 🛠️ Tasks:

1. Create Databricks Community Edition account
2. Navigate Workspace, Compute, Data Explorer
3. Create first notebook
4. Run basic PySpark commands

## Notes / Takeaways
This session reinforced why Databricks is becoming the go-to platform for scalable data engineering, analytics, and AI workloads.

Since we’re using Kaggle for datasets, I went a step further and configured secrets in Databricks using the DatabricksCLI from the terminal to securely manage credentials.

Looking forward to diving deeper into Spark, data processing, and real-world pipelines in the coming days.
